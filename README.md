# Welcome To Flooded Only!

This mod does exactly what it says it does, it makes every moon flooded! even the company building!

I'm currently not taking any discord DMs or really looking at things, if you want to you can go to my github link and put in bugs or issues or possible suggestions thank you

During this mod's development I realized the three moons Titan, Rend and Embrion do not have any flood values so I added my own.

### Titan

- My reasoning behind the Titan change was so that you have to use the fire exit stairs from the side in order to continue, it is however possible to use the main stairs just at a risk.

### Embrion

- Embrion is an overall silly moon, for some reason when I tried to mod this my idea was to make it so it was a cruiser map but for some reason your stam isn't taken away while you run therefore making it silly, don't drown.

### Rend
- My reasoning behind Rend was to take out the fire exit and take out the left side main entrance from play forcing you to take the less lit route most of the day and definitely at the end of the day.
